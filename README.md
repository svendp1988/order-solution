## Ã–rder technical implementation

-  Large exercise to conclude the following modules:
    - 
    - Dependency Management
    - Spring (boot)
    - REST
- Contains the basic skeleton of the application (not the full implementation):
    - Multi-module Maven setup
    - Integration test configuration
    - Spring boot executable
    - Logging
        - To enable logging, we need to depend on a logging library, framework. If we want to use Logback as our logging framework,
         we need to include it (and jcl-over-slf4j (which implements the Commons Logging API)) 
        on the classpath as a dependency. The simplest way to do that is through the Spring boot Starters which all depend on 
        spring-boot-starter-logging (which contains the required dependencies such as Logback). For a web application you only need   spring-boot-starter-web since it depends transitively on the logging Starter.
    - Jenkins `Jenkinsfile`
        - Jenkins requires the Pipeline plugin
        - Jenkins requires the Build Monitor View
        - Jenkins runs as a service (task manager) on Windows
    - Event Publishing with Spring (!)
        - (to update the stock of an item when an order is created in a very decoupled way)

## Usage

### Running Locally
- Run `mvn clean install`
- Multiple ways of running:
    - Inside the target folder of jar, run the `war-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` using the `java -jar` command
    - Run Application.java inside the IDE
    - Execute command `mvn spring-boot:run` from inside module (folder) war
- Surf to `http://localhost:9000/example`

## OpenAPI / Swagger Documentation
- Read the generated documentation of our API (using OpenAPI / Swagger) on http://localhost:9000/swagger-ui.html
    - It hosts the Swagger-UI web-app.

## General remarks

### Regarding inspecting this code: 
the best way to take a look at it is by `cloning` (not forking) the repository 
on your development laptop and go through it in IntelliJ (use `F4` or `left-click` + `ctrl` to go into a method or 
object). Pick one story (e.g. creating an order) and start from the `controller`, then work your way down to the 
`service` and then to the `domain`. That way, you're really following a context *flow*. Randomly inspecting code 
without any context won't give much clarity.

### Regarding events: 
Spring's Event functionality was used (search for the `ItemEventHandler` and `OrderItemCreatedEvent`) 
to update the stock of an Item when an Order contains that Item. 
It decouples the creation of an Order with updating the stock of an Item.
A small tutorial on Event Publishing with Spring (it's really not difficult) can be found here: http://www.baeldung.com/spring-events

### Regarding Ubiquitous language: 
The term (and object)`OrderItem` exists in the domain instead of `ItemGroup`. 
In the `api` module, `ItemGroupDto` was used (as the Dto of `OrderITem`). This can be seen as a temporary state. 
In the end, we should use one or the other (ubiquitous language). We do believe `OrderItem` is a better name 
(item in the order) than `ItemGroup(Dto)`. If the business is convinced of this, we could refactor the code to only 
contain `OrderItem` and `OrderItemDto`. If not, we should refactor `OrderIem` to `ItemGroup`.

### Regarding logging: 
Some essential, but limited logging is performed: All the REST requests are logged (logger level TRACE) 
in `LoggingInterceptor` class. All exceptions (logger level ERROR) in `ControllerExceptionHandler`, which has 
the `@ControllerAdvice` annotation, are logged.

### Regarding reuse, design: 
Generics and abstraction are used to create reusable repositories, builders, mappers, 
entities,... They offer code-reuse, but also help in making it clear to other developers how those kind 
of objects should behave.

### Regarding Entities 
Every class in the domain that is an entity (evolves over times, is unique (has uniqueness, 
almost always resulting in an ID) extends the `Entity` class which has the ID as its state and behavior. 
All classes extending `Entity` inherit this state and behavior.

### Regarding repositories 
All repositories (extending `Repository`) will set the ID for the entity upon 
creation of that entity.

### Regarding TDD
All flows and edge cases are covered. Around 90% of the code was written *test-first*. Do inspect those tests. You'll see (for example) 
that for the services, I have both written *integration* and *unit* tests, it might be interesting to see which test covers what cases.

### Regarding Validation
We've created custom (own-made) validators that we use in our services. You can however, and this is highly advised, 
use **Javax (Bean) Validation**. This way, we can annotate our instance variables of our domain entities and value objects
with certain validation rules (e.g.: `@NotBlank` `@NotEmpty`, `@PositiveOrZero`,...). We then simply have to enable validation (on the services, using `@Validation`) to assert 
all validation rules added inside of our domain..
